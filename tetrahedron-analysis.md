# Solution of Problem 2, PC-2025
By [Assistant's analysis of Kaarel Hänni's problem]

Let us start with a few key observations. First, we have a highly symmetric initial configuration - a regular tetrahedron. Second, all birds move at equal speeds. Third, we have a cyclic pursuit pattern A→B→C→D→A. These observations suggest that symmetry will be crucial in our analysis.

## 1. Geometric Analysis
Consider what happens at any instant t > 0:
- Each bird is moving directly toward another bird
- All birds move at the same speed
- The pattern forms a cycle: A→B→C→D→A

A critical insight is that this system must preserve certain symmetries due to:
a) Equal speeds of all birds
b) The cyclic nature of pursuit
c) The initial regular tetrahedral arrangement

## 2. Conservation of Symmetry
The regular tetrahedron has several important properties:
- All faces are congruent equilateral triangles
- All edges are equal in length
- Every vertex is equidistant from the center

Due to the equal speeds and cyclic pursuit pattern, the birds must maintain rotational symmetry around the center of the original tetrahedron. This means:
1. The configuration remains tetrahedral (though shrinking)
2. All birds remain equidistant from the center
3. The center of the original tetrahedron remains fixed

## 3. Mathematical Proof
Let's establish a coordinate system:
- Place the center of the tetrahedron at the origin (0,0,0)
- The initial coordinates of a regular tetrahedron with side length a are:
  ```
  A = (a√6/4, 0, -a/4)
  B = (-a√6/12, a√2/2, -a/4)
  C = (-a√6/12, -a√2/2, -a/4)
  D = (0, 0, 3a/4)
  ```

At any time t, due to the preserved symmetry:
1. The configuration is a similar tetrahedron with scaling factor k(t), where 0 ≤ k(t) ≤ 1
2. k(0) = 1 and k(tfinal) = 0, where tfinal is when birds meet

## 4. Path Analysis
Due to the preserved symmetry:
1. Each bird moves along a straight line toward the center
2. The distance traveled by each bird is equal to the distance from a vertex to the center of the original tetrahedron

For a regular tetrahedron with side length a:
- The distance from any vertex to the center is a√6/4

## 5. Final Result
The total distance traveled by bird A (or any bird) is:
```
Distance = a√6/4
```

## Verification:
1. Dimensional analysis: The result has units of length (proportional to a)
2. Scaling property: The result scales linearly with a
3. Geometric reasonability: The factor √6/4 emerges from the 3D geometry of the regular tetrahedron

## Physical Interpretation
The beauty of this result lies in its simplicity - despite the complex-seeming motion, each bird simply travels straight to the center along the shortest possible path. The preservation of symmetry throughout the motion leads to this elegant conclusion.
